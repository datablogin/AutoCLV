# Next Steps: Connect Claude Desktop to Your MCP Server

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

The `ModuleNotFoundError` has been fixed! The issue was that `uv run python` doesn't automatically install your local package.

**Solution**: Added a script entry point that automatically handles package installation.

## üöÄ Connect to Claude Desktop Now

### Step 1: Update Claude Desktop Configuration

Edit this file:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "four-lenses-analytics": {
      "command": "/Users/robertwelborn/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/.worktrees/track-a",
        "mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- If your `uv` is installed elsewhere, find it with: `which uv`
- Make sure the path `/Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/.worktrees/track-a` exists

### Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for the config changes to take effect.

### Step 3: Verify Connection

In Claude Desktop, you should see:
1. **MCP Servers List**: "Four Lenses Analytics" should appear
2. **Available Tools**: `health_check` tool should be available

### Step 4: Test the Health Check

Try asking Claude:
> "Use the health_check tool from the Four Lenses Analytics server"

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "phase": "Phase 0 - Infrastructure Setup",
  "server_name": "Four Lenses Analytics"
}
```

## üìù Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Run the server locally (for testing)
uv run mcp-server

# View help
uv run mcp-server --help

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/services/mcp_server/ -v

# Run from a different directory
uv run --directory /Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/.worktrees/track-a mcp-server
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" in Claude Desktop

1. **Check the logs**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
2. **Verify uv path**: Run `which uv` and update config if different
3. **Test manually**: Run `uv run mcp-server` from terminal
4. **Check project path**: Make sure the directory exists

### "No such command: mcp-server"

Run this to sync the package:
```bash
cd /Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/.worktrees/track-a
uv sync
```

### Still seeing ModuleNotFoundError

Make sure you're using the NEW configuration with:
- `"command": "/Users/robertwelborn/.local/bin/uv"`
- `"args": ["run", "--directory", "...", "mcp-server"]`

NOT the old configuration with `python -m analytics...`
