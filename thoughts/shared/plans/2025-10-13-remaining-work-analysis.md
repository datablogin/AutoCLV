## Open Issues Analysis

### High Priority Issues (Critical Path)

#### Issue #58: Data Safety - Cohort Assignment (Track A)
**Status**: OPEN
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 1 day
**Description**: `assign_cohorts()` defaults to `require_full_coverage=False`, silently dropping customers outside cohort ranges without warnings.

**Impact**: Medium severity - potential data loss in CLV calculations leading to biased estimates.

**Recommendation**:
- Change default to `require_full_coverage=True` (safer default)
- Add warning logging when customers are dropped
- Update tests and documentation
- **This should be next Track A task**

**Files**:
- `customer_base_audit/foundation/cohorts.py:150-231`
- `tests/test_cohorts.py:125-143`

---

#### Issue #35: Lens 5 Overall Customer Base Health (Track B)
**Status**: OPEN
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Description**: Implement comprehensive customer base health module combining insights from all other lenses.

**Current State**: Stub only (16 lines of TODO comments)

**Expected Implementation** (based on lens4.py complexity):
- ~300-500 lines of implementation
- Overall health score (0-100)
- Customer base composition by cohort
- Revenue distribution by cohort
- Weighted retention rate across entire customer base
- Integration of Lenses 1-4 insights

**Files**:
- `customer_base_audit/analyses/lens5.py` - currently stub
- `tests/test_lens5.py` - doesn't exist yet

**Dependencies**: All other lenses complete (they are)

---

#### Issues #61-64: Model Prep Quality Issues (Track B)
**Status**: OPEN
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 3-4 days total
**Description**: Four quality issues identified in model_prep module:

1. **Issue #61**: Missing observation_start validation, type inconsistency
2. **Issue #62**: Timezone handling, time calculation constants, bias quantification
3. **Issue #63**: DataFrame sorting inconsistency, performance issues
4. **Issue #64**: Missing tests and enhanced documentation

**Impact**: These affect the quality and reliability of CLV model inputs, which cascades to prediction accuracy.

**Recommendation**: Address in order (#61 → #62 → #63 → #64) as they build on each other.

**Files**:
- `customer_base_audit/models/model_prep.py` (315 lines)
- `tests/test_model_prep.py` (518 lines)
