# Research: Track Merge Strategy and Issue Assignment for Project Completion

**Date**: 2025-10-21T00:00:00-04:00
**Researcher**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Git Commit**: 9d4196fc81e82a4572b5b7d5374f8cd6ce32e8f4
**Branch**: feature/issue-118-phase4b (track-a worktree)
**Repository**: AutoCLV

## Research Question

We are trying to finish this project. Review the open GitHub issues and determine what we can put into track-a and track-b and what we should do to merge the tracks as we get to the end of the project.

## Summary

The AutoCLV project has **evolved architecturally** from the original "Five Lenses" implementation to an **Agentic MCP Server with Orchestration** approach. There are currently **4 active development streams**:

1. **Main Branch** (`feature/phase1-rich-formatters`): Rich visualization/formatting layer
2. **Track-A** (`feature/issue-118-phase4b`): Agentic MCP server with orchestration (Phase 4B/5)
3. **Track-B** (`feature/track-b-clv-models`): CLV models and analytics infrastructure
4. **Track-C** (`test/end-to-end-integration`): Testing and documentation

**Current Status**: The project is **~80-85% complete** with **22 open issues** split between the OLD architecture (Issues #94-97, #111-116) focused on "Agentic Five Lenses" and the NEW architecture (#122-129) focused on tech debt and optimizations.

**Merge Strategy**: There is **significant architectural divergence** between the tracks that suggests they represent **different implementation approaches** rather than parallel work streams. Recommendation: **Consolidate around Track-A** as the primary implementation path.

#### Category 3: Remaining Core Work

Based on the research documents I read, the following core work remains incomplete:

**Lens 2-4 Full Implementations**
- **Current State**: Lenses 2, 3, 4 return placeholder data in Track-A
- **Track Assignment**: **Track-A**
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**:
  - Lens 2: 2-3 days

- **Current State**: Basic Plotly charts exist, advanced visualizations missing
- **Track Assignment**: **Main Branch**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: 5-6 days

- **Priority**: Low
- **Effort**: 6+ days
- **Scope**: Anomaly alerts, scenario planning, industry benchmarking

### Track Divergence Analysis

#### Why Track-A and Track-B Diverged

Track-A and Track-B represent **two fundamentally different architectural approaches** to solving the customer analytics problem:

**Track-A Philosophy**: **API-First, LLM-Enabled, Production-Ready**
- MCP server as primary interface
- Claude Desktop as user interface
- LangGraph for intelligent orchestration
- LLM-powered natural language understanding
- Full observability stack (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Circuit breakers and resilience patterns
- Query caching for cost optimization

**Track-B Philosophy**: **Library-First, Analytics Infrastructure**
- Complete analytics library ecosystem
- Supports traditional Python workflows
- No MCP dependency
- Direct function calls, not orchestration
- Focused on data warehouse connectors, ML models, streaming analytics

These are **complementary but incompatible at the integration layer**. Track-B's libraries could be **consumed by** Track-A's MCP server, but Track-B does not have an MCP server of its own.

#### Integration Possibilities

**Option 1: Track-A as Primary, Track-B as Library Provider**
- Merge Track-B's `analytics/libs/` into Track-A
- Use Track-B's libraries from Track-A's MCP tools
- Discard Track-B's simpler `customer_base_audit/` structure (Track-A's is more advanced)

**Option 2: Parallel Deployment (Current Implicit Strategy)**
- Track-A: Production MCP server for Claude Desktop users
- Track-B: Python library for direct API users (data scientists, Jupyter notebooks)
- Shared core: `customer_base_audit/` foundation

**Option 3: Retire Track-B, Consolidate in Track-A**
- Track-A already has complete functionality
- Track-B's analytics libraries may not be needed if Track-A meets all requirements
- Simplifies maintenance

### Merge Strategy Recommendation

Based on the analysis, here is the recommended merge strategy:

#### Phase 1: Issue Cleanup (This Week)

**Close Completed Issues** (Issues #94-97, #111-114):
- These issues describe work that is **already complete** in Track-A
- Update issue comments to reference Track-A implementation
- Close with label "completed-in-track-a"

**Reassign Active Issues**:
- Issue #115 → Main Branch (`feature/phase1-rich-formatters`)
- Issue #116 → Backlog (low priority, future work)
- Issues #122-127 → Track-A (`feature/issue-118-phase4b`)
- Issue #129 → Main Branch (formatters)

#### Phase 2: Complete Track-A Core Work (Week 1-2)

**Week 1: Lens 2-3 Full Implementations**
- Implement full Lens 2 tool wrapper in Track-A
- Implement full Lens 3 tool wrapper in Track-A
- Write comprehensive tests for both
- Update documentation

**Week 2: Lens 4 Full Implementation + Tech Debt**
- Implement full Lens 4 tool wrapper in Track-A
- Address high-priority tech debt issues (#122, #125)
- Write comprehensive tests

#### Phase 3: Main Branch Formatter Work (Week 3)

**Complete Enhanced Visualizations** (Issue #115):
- Interactive dashboards
- Trend charts
- Cohort heatmaps
- Sankey diagrams
- Optimize chart token usage (Issue #129)

#### Phase 4: Merge Main → Track-A (Week 4)

**Integrate Formatters into Track-A**:
- Copy enhanced formatters from Main to Track-A
- Update `orchestration/coordinator.py` to use new formatters
- Integration testing with Claude Desktop
- Update documentation

#### Phase 5: Track-B Decision (Week 4)

**Evaluate Track-B Libraries**:
- Determine if any `analytics/libs/` modules are needed for Track-A
- If yes, selectively merge into Track-A
- If no, archive Track-B as alternative implementation

**Options**:
1. **Merge Useful Libraries**: Copy needed modules from Track-B's `analytics/libs/` to Track-A
2. **Archive Track-B**: Document as alternative architecture, keep for reference
3. **Maintain Parallel**: If Track-B serves a different user base (non-MCP users)

**Recommendation**: **Archive Track-B** unless there's a specific requirement for non-MCP library usage

#### Phase 6: Track-A → Main Merge (Week 5)

**Final Integration**:
- Merge Track-A (complete MCP server) back to Main
- Resolve any conflicts with Main's formatter work
- Update README and documentation for unified architecture
- Tag release v1.0.0

   - **Answer Needed From**: Track-C developer/maintainer
   - **Impact**: Determines merge strategy for Track-C

3. **Issue Priority**: Are Issues #115-116 required for v1.0.0 or can they be deferred to v1.1.0?
   - **Answer Needed From**: Product/project owner
   - **Impact**: Affects timeline to v1.0.0 release

4. **Non-MCP Users**: Are there users who need direct Python API access (Track-B style) vs MCP server access?
   - **Answer Needed From**: Product/project owner
   - **Impact**: Determines whether to maintain Track-B in parallel

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Close Duplicate Issues**: Close Issues #94-97, #111-114 as "completed-in-track-a"
2. **Reassign Active Issues**:
   - #115, #129 → Main Branch
   - #122-127 → Track-A
   - #116 → Backlog
3. **Prioritize Lens 2-4 Implementations**: This is the most critical remaining work in Track-A

### Strategic Decisions (This Month)

4. **Evaluate Track-B**: Determine merge, archive, or parallel maintenance strategy
5. **Define v1.0.0 Scope**: Decide if enhanced visualizations (#115) are required or can be v1.1.0
6. **Plan Final Merge**: Create detailed merge plan for Track-A → Main

### Quality Assurance

7. **Integration Testing**: Ensure all Track-A features work end-to-end in Claude Desktop
8. **Performance Testing**: Verify observability stack (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana) works in production
9. **Security Review**: Complete Issue #125 (prompt injection) before production deployment

## Conclusion

The AutoCLV project has successfully evolved from a traditional Five Lenses implementation to a **production-ready Agentic MCP Server** with LLM capabilities, orchestration, and comprehensive observability.

**Current State**: 80-85% complete with a clear path to 100%

**Primary Track**: **Track-A** is the production implementation path

**Merge Strategy**: Consolidate work from Main (formatters) and selectively from Track-B (libraries if needed) into Track-A, then merge Track-A back to Main for v1.0.0 release

**Timeline**: 5 weeks to completion with focused work on Lens 2-4 implementations and enhanced visualizations

**Critical Path**:
1. Complete Lens 2-4 full implementations in Track-A (Week 1-2)
2. Enhance visualizations in Main (Week 3)
3. Integrate Main → Track-A (Week 4)
4. Final merge Track-A → Main (Week 5)

The project is well-positioned for successful completion with the recommended merge strategy and timeline.
