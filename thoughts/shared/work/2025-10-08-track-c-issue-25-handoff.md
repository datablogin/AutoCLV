# Track C Handoff: Issue #25 - Lenses 1-3 Usage Examples (Partial)

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Phase:** 2
**Track:** C (Developer Experience - Documentation, Testing, Integration)
**Issue:** #25
**Worktree:** `.worktrees/track-c`
**Branch:** `feature/track-c-docs-tests`
**Status:** Partial Complete ⚠️

## Summary

Added comprehensive usage examples and documentation for **Lens 1** to the user guide. Lens 2 and Lens 3 documentation cannot be completed yet because those modules are still in TODO status (not yet implemented by Track A).

## Work Completed

### Files Modified
- **`docs/user_guide.md`**: Added complete Lens 1 documentation with working examples

### Changes Made

#### Lens 1 Documentation (✅ Complete)
1. **Overview section**: Explained what Lens 1 analyzes and what questions it answers
2. **Working code example**:
   - Uses Texas CLV synthetic data (1000 customers)
   - Demonstrates complete workflow: data generation → data mart → RFM → Lens 1
   - All imports and function calls tested and verified
3. **Interpretation guidance**:
   - One-time buyer percentage thresholds and meanings
   - Revenue concentration (Pareto analysis) interpretation
   - RFM distribution pattern analysis
4. **Real example output**: Actual output from running the code (343 customers, 2.92% one-time buyers, etc.)
5. **Common patterns section**: Three business scenarios with actionable insights

#### Lens 2 & 3 Placeholders (⚠️ Blocked)
- Added status notices indicating implementation is in progress
- Listed features that will be documented when available
- Clear indication that documentation will be added post-implementation

## Blocking Issues

**Issue #25 cannot be fully completed until:**
- Issue #23: Lens 2 implementation (Track A, Phase 2) - Currently TODO placeholder
- Issue #24: Lens 3 implementation (Track B, Phase 2) - Currently TODO placeholder

## Git Activity

**Commits Made:**
1. Initial Lens 1 documentation with comprehensive examples
2. Fixed code example API usage (CustomerDataMartBuilder.build() method)
3. Updated example output with actual test results

**Branch:** `feature/track-c-docs-tests`
**Pushed:** Pending

## Code Testing

✅ **Lens 1 example tested and verified:**
```
Total Customers: 343
One-Time Buyers: 10 (2.92%)
Total Revenue: $1,195,624.61
Top 10% Revenue Contribution: 23.0%
Top 20% Revenue Contribution: 41.3%
Avg Orders per Customer: 15.74
Median Customer Value: $3233.89
```

All code examples:
- Use correct API calls
- Execute without errors
- Produce realistic output
- Follow established code patterns from tests

## Documentation Quality

**Lens 1 Section Includes:**
- ✅ Clear explanation of what Lens 1 does
- ✅ Step-by-step code example with comments
- ✅ Real output from Texas CLV synthetic data
- ✅ Interpretation guidelines for all key metrics
- ✅ Business pattern recognition guide
- ✅ Actionable insights for different scenarios

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This PR)
1. ✅ Commit Lens 1 documentation
2. ⏳ Create PR noting partial completion
3. ⏳ Reference blocking issues #23 and #24

### Future (When Unblocked)
1. **After Issue #23 completes**: Add Lens 2 documentation with examples
2. **After Issue #24 completes**: Add Lens 3 documentation with examples
3. **When all complete**: Update PR and complete Issue #25

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- None currently (Lens 1 documentation is standalone)

**Blocked by:**
- Issue #23: Implement Lens 2 (Track A) - IN PROGRESS
- Issue #24: Implement Lens 3 (Track B) - IN PROGRESS

## Acceptance Criteria Status

From Issue #25:
- ✅ Code examples are syntactically correct
- ✅ Code examples execute without errors
- ✅ Interpretation guidance is clear and actionable
- ✅ Examples use Texas CLV synthetic data
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Only Lens 1 complete (Lens 2 & 3 blocked by implementation)

## Issues Encountered

1. **API Discovery**: Initial code example used incorrect CustomerDataMartBuilder API
   - **Resolution**: Reviewed tests and source to find correct `builder.build()` pattern
   - **Impact**: Delayed testing by ~15 minutes

2. **Lens 2 & 3 Not Implemented**: Discovered during implementation that Lens 2 and 3 are TODO placeholders
   - **Resolution**: Added status notices and documented what will be included
   - **Impact**: Issue #25 can only be partially completed now

## Resources Used

- Plan document: `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-08-enterprise-clv-implementation.md`
- Source code: `customer_base_audit/foundation/rfm.py`, `customer_base_audit/analyses/lens1.py`
- Tests: `tests/test_rfm.py`, `tests/test_lens1.py`
- Synthetic data: `customer_base_audit/synthetic/texas_clv_client.py`
- GitHub issue: #25

## Time Spent

Approximately 90 minutes:
- 30min: Research APIs and understand module structure
- 30min: Write Lens 1 documentation
- 15min: Test and fix code example
- 15min: Add interpretation guidance and patterns

## Handoff Notes

This PR provides **complete, working documentation for Lens 1**. Users can immediately use this to understand and run Lens 1 analysis on their own data or the Texas CLV synthetic dataset.

**Lens 2 and Lens 3 documentation must wait for implementation** by Track A and Track B respectively. The user guide includes clear status notices so users know what's coming.

**PR ready to create:** Yes ✅ (with partial completion noted)

## Recommendation

**Option 1** (Recommended): Create PR now for Lens 1 documentation only
- Provides immediate value to users
- Unblocks anyone wanting to use Lens 1
- Can be extended when Lens 2 & 3 are ready

**Option 2**: Wait for Lens 2 & 3 implementation before creating PR
- Provides complete documentation in single PR
- Delays value delivery
- Ties documentation to implementation timeline
