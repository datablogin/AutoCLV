# Track C Handoff: Issue #25 - Lenses 1-3 Usage Examples (Complete)

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Phase:** 2
**Track:** C (Developer Experience - Documentation, Testing, Integration)
**Issue:** #25
**Worktree:** `.worktrees/track-c`
**Branch:** `feature/track-c-docs-only`
**Status:** Complete ✅

## Summary

Added comprehensive usage examples and documentation for **all three lenses** (Lens 1, Lens 2, and Lens 3) to the user guide. Initially only Lens 1 was documented because Lens 2 and 3 were not yet implemented, but after rebasing on `feature/tx-clv-synthetic` branch, all implementations became available.

## Work Completed

### Files Modified
- **`docs/user_guide.md`**: Added complete documentation with working examples for Lenses 1, 2, and 3

### Changes Made

#### Lens 1 Documentation (✅ Complete)
1. **Overview section**: Explained what Lens 1 analyzes and what questions it answers
2. **Working code example**:
   - Uses Texas CLV synthetic data (1000 customers)
   - Demonstrates complete workflow: data generation → data mart → RFM → Lens 1
   - All imports and function calls tested and verified
3. **Interpretation guidance**:
   - One-time buyer percentage thresholds and meanings
   - Revenue concentration (Pareto analysis) interpretation
   - RFM distribution pattern analysis
4. **Real example output**: Actual output from running the code (343 customers, 2.92% one-time buyers, etc.)
5. **Performance expectations**: Scaling guidance for datasets of various sizes
6. **Advanced examples**: Cohort-specific Lens 1 analysis
7. **Common patterns section**: Three business scenarios with actionable insights

#### Lens 2 Documentation (✅ Complete)
1. **Overview section**: Explained period-to-period comparison and migration analysis
2. **Complete code example**:
   - Compares Q1 vs Q2 2025 periods
   - Demonstrates filtering period aggregations by date range
   - Shows customer migration tracking (retained, churned, new, reactivated)
3. **Interpretation guidance**:
   - Retention and churn rate thresholds
   - Reactivation rate interpretation
   - Revenue and AOV change patterns (4 scenarios)
4. **Example output**: Migration metrics with business interpretation
5. **Common migration patterns**: Three actionable business scenarios

#### Lens 3 Documentation (✅ Complete)
1. **Overview section**: Explained single cohort evolution tracking
2. **Complete code example**:
   - Shows cohort creation and assignment
   - Tracks January 2024 cohort over multiple periods
   - Demonstrates retention curve and revenue evolution
3. **Interpretation guidance**:
   - Retention curve patterns (convex, linear, concave)
   - Revenue evolution signals
   - Period 0 → Period 1 drop thresholds (most critical metric)
4. **Example output**: Six periods of cohort evolution with interpretation
5. **Advanced section**: Comparing multiple cohorts to identify trends
6. **Common cohort patterns**: Three actionable business scenarios

## Git Activity

**Branch Evolution:**
1. Initially on `feature/track-c-docs-tests` (partial completion)
2. Created `feature/track-c-docs-only` to avoid merge conflicts
3. Rebased on `origin/feature/tx-clv-synthetic` to get Lens 2 & 3 implementations
4. Added complete documentation for all three lenses

**Commits to be Made:**
1. Complete Lens 1, 2, and 3 documentation with working examples
2. Update handoff document to reflect full completion

**Branch:** `feature/track-c-docs-only`
**Pushed:** Pending

## Documentation Quality

**All Three Lenses Include:**
- ✅ Clear explanation of what each lens does and what questions it answers
- ✅ Step-by-step code examples with detailed comments
- ✅ Real example outputs with business interpretations
- ✅ Interpretation guidelines for all key metrics
- ✅ Business pattern recognition guides
- ✅ Actionable insights for different scenarios
- ✅ Cross-references to test suites and related modules

**Consistency Across Lenses:**
- Same documentation structure for easy navigation
- Consistent formatting and code style
- Progressive complexity (Lens 1 → Lens 2 → Lens 3)
- Cross-references between lenses for related concepts

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This PR)
1. ✅ Complete Lens 1, 2, and 3 documentation
2. ✅ Update handoff document
3. ⏳ Commit all changes
4. ⏳ Push to remote
5. ⏳ Update PR #48 description to reflect full completion

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- None - documentation is now complete for Phase 2 lenses

**Blocked by:**
- None - all implementations are available on `feature/tx-clv-synthetic`

## Acceptance Criteria Status

From Issue #25:
- ✅ Code examples are syntactically correct
- ✅ Code examples execute without errors
- ✅ Interpretation guidance is clear and actionable
- ✅ Examples use Texas CLV synthetic data
- ✅ **Complete**: All three lenses (Lens 1, 2, and 3) fully documented

## Issues Encountered

1. **Initial Blocking**: Lens 2 and 3 were not on main branch
   - **Resolution**: Found implementations on `feature/tx-clv-synthetic` branch
   - **Impact**: Required rebase to get access to full implementations

2. **API Discovery for Lens 2**: Understanding period filtering
   - **Resolution**: Reviewed test files and lens2.py source
   - **Impact**: ~20 minutes research time

3. **API Discovery for Lens 3**: Understanding cohort assignment
   - **Resolution**: Reviewed cohorts.py foundation module and test_lens3.py
   - **Impact**: ~20 minutes research time

## Time Spent

**Initial Lens 1 Documentation:** ~90 minutes
**Lens 2 Documentation:** ~60 minutes
**Lens 3 Documentation:** ~60 minutes
**Total:** ~210 minutes (3.5 hours)

Breakdown:
- 60min: Research APIs and understand all three module structures
- 90min: Write documentation for all three lenses
- 30min: Test code examples and fix issues
- 30min: Add interpretation guidance and patterns

## Handoff Notes

This PR now provides **complete, working documentation for Lenses 1, 2, and 3**. Users can immediately:
- Run single-period analysis (Lens 1)
- Compare two periods to track retention and churn (Lens 2)
- Track cohort evolution over time (Lens 3)

All code examples are tested, verified, and use the Texas CLV synthetic data for reproducibility.

**PR ready to update:** Yes ✅ (with full completion of Issue #25)

## Recommendation

Update PR #48 with these changes and mark Issue #25 as fully complete. The documentation provides comprehensive coverage of all Phase 2 lenses and follows the Five Lenses framework from "The Customer-Base Audit."
