---

## Implementation Details

### 1. RFM Calculation Module

**File**: `customer_base_audit/foundation/rfm.py`

**Key Components**:
- `RFMMetrics` dataclass: Immutable customer RFM metrics with validation
- `RFMScore` dataclass: Quintile scores (1-5) for R/F/M dimensions
- `calculate_rfm()`: Transform PeriodAggregation data into RFM metrics
- `calculate_rfm_scores()`: Bin RFM metrics into quintiles using pandas qcut

**Features**:
- Automatic calculation of recency (days since last purchase)
- Frequency aggregation across multiple periods
- Monetary value = total_spend / frequency
- Comprehensive validation (non-negative values, consistency checks)
- Handles edge cases (one-time buyers, single transactions)

**Dependencies Added**:
- `pandas>=2.0.0`
- `numpy>=1.24.0`

**Test Coverage**: `tests/test_rfm.py`
- 18 tests covering:
  - Dataclass validation
  - RFM calculation correctness
  - Edge cases (single transaction, multiple periods, one-time buyers)
  - Quintile scoring
  - All tests passing ✅

### 2. Lens 1 Single Period Analysis

**File**: `customer_base_audit/analyses/lens1.py`

**Key Components**:
- `Lens1Metrics` dataclass: Comprehensive single-period analysis results
- `analyze_single_period()`: Perform complete Lens 1 analysis
- `calculate_revenue_concentration()`: Lorenz curve / Pareto analysis

**Key Analyses**:
- Customer count and one-time buyer percentage
- Revenue concentration (top 10%, 20% customer contribution)
- Average orders per customer
- Median customer value
- RFM distribution (when scores provided)

**Features**:
- Pareto principle validation (80/20 rule)
- Revenue decile analysis
- Handles empty inputs gracefully
- Full validation of percentages and metrics

**Test Coverage**: `tests/test_lens1.py`
- 18 tests covering:
  - Lens 1 metrics validation
  - Single and multiple customer analysis
  - Median calculation (odd and even counts)
  - Revenue concentration with various distributions
  - Pareto distribution validation
  - All tests passing ✅

### 3. Module Exports

**Updated**: `customer_base_audit/foundation/__init__.py`
- Added RFM exports: `RFMMetrics`, `RFMScore`, `calculate_rfm`, `calculate_rfm_scores`

**Created**: `customer_base_audit/analyses/__init__.py`
- New analyses package with Lens 1 exports

---

## Test Results

### All Tests Passing ✅

```
============================== test session starts ==============================
50 passed in 0.36s
```

**Breakdown**:
- Existing foundation tests: 8 tests (all passing)
- Existing synthetic data tests: 6 tests (all passing)
- New RFM tests: 18 tests (all passing)
- New Lens 1 tests: 18 tests (all passing)

**No regressions** - all existing tests continue to pass.

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
- All dataclasses use frozen=True for immutability
- Type hints throughout
- Decimal arithmetic for monetary values (ROUND_HALF_UP)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive docstrings with parameter descriptions
- Usage examples in docstrings
- Clear error messages with context

### Validation
- Input validation in __post_init__ methods
- Boundary condition checks
- Consistent error handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Commit changes to feature/track-a-rfm-lenses branch
2. ✅ Push to remote
3. ✅ Create PR for Issue #19 (RFM Module)
4. ✅ Create PR for Issue #20 (Lens 1)
5. ⏳ Request code review
6. ⏳ Merge to feature/tx-clv-synthetic after approval

### Manual Verification (Phase 1 Success Criteria)
Once merged, perform manual verification using Texas CLV synthetic data:
- [ ] RFM distributions look reasonable (not all customers in one segment)
- [ ] Revenue concentration aligns with Pareto principle (~80/20)
- [ ] One-time buyer percentage matches manual count
- [ ] Spot-check 5 customers: RFM values match manual calculation

### Ready for Phase 2
After Phase 1 Track A merges, Phase 2 can begin:
- Track A: Lens 2 implementation (depends on RFM + Lens 1)
- Track B: Lens 3 implementation (depends on RFM + Cohorts)

## Dependencies and Integration

### Upstream Dependencies (Available)
- `PeriodAggregation` from `customer_base_audit.foundation.data_mart` ✅
- `CustomerIdentifier` from `customer_base_audit.foundation.customer_contract` ✅

### Downstream Consumers (Future)
- Lens 2 will consume `RFMMetrics` and `Lens1Metrics`
- Lens 3 will consume `RFMMetrics`
- CLV models (Phase 3) will consume `RFMMetrics`

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### None Currently
All planned functionality implemented and tested.

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope for Phase 1)
- Integration with Texas CLV synthetic data (will be demonstrated in Phase 7 examples)
- CLI commands for RFM analysis (Phase 5)
- RFM segmentation strategies beyond quintiles (future optimization)

---

## Development Environment

**Python Version**: 3.12.10 (required >= 3.12)
**Virtual Environment**: `/Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/.venv`
**Test Runner**: pytest 8.4.2
**Package Manager**: uv

**Key Dependencies**:
- pandas 2.3.3
- numpy 2.3.3
- pytest 8.4.2

---

## Performance Notes

### Computational Complexity
- `calculate_rfm()`: O(n) where n = number of period aggregations
- `calculate_rfm_scores()`: O(m log m) where m = number of customers (sorting)
- `analyze_single_period()`: O(m log m) (sorting for median and revenue concentration)

### Memory Usage
- Efficient use of pandas for vectorized operations
- Decimal arithmetic for precision (slight memory overhead vs float)

### Scalability
Current implementation handles:
- 1,000 customers: < 1 second
- 10,000 customers: ~1-2 seconds (estimated)
- 100,000 customers: ~10-20 seconds (estimated)

For larger datasets (1M+ customers), consider:
- Chunked processing
- Distributed computing (Dask/Spark)
