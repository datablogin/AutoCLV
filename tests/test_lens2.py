Tests for Lens 2: Period-to-Period Comparison

TODO: Implement comprehensive test suite for Lens 2 module covering:
- Period comparison accuracy
- Customer migration calculations (new, retained, churned, resurrected)
- Retention and churn rate validation
- Period-over-period growth metrics
- Edge cases (no overlap, complete overlap, etc.)
- Integration with Lens 1 outputs

Tests should validate customer state transitions between periods.
