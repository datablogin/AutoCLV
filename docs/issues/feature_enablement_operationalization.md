**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Even with shared tooling, teams struggle to adopt the audit workflow due to unclear documentation, missing runbooks, and inconsistent orchestration. Without structured enablement, adoption stalls and knowledge remains siloed.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Launch an enablement program that operationalizes the audit stack:
- Documentation suite (playbooks, decision log, FAQ) describing customer definition, data mart usage, Lens interpretation, and troubleshooting.
- Training assets (recorded walkthroughs, notebooks, hands-on labs) for analysts, engineers, and product partners.
- Orchestration scaffolding (e.g., Prefect/Airflow/Dagster templates) with sample DAGs to schedule refreshes and publish outputs.
- Governance checklist linking KPIs, run cadence, and stakeholder notifications.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Rely on informal peer mentoring (slow, fragile, high attrition risk).
- Defer enablement until after tooling is complete (delays value realization, leads to low adoption).

**Additional context**
- **Expected outcomes:**
  - Every target squad completes onboarding and can self-serve audit runs.
  - Refresh cadence agreed with stakeholders and executed via orchestrator templates.
  - Reduced support tickets for “how do I run the audit?” questions.
- **Acceptability tests:**
  - Documentation passes SME review and is published in central knowledge base.
  - Pilot cohort completes training and successfully runs audit unaided.
  - Orchestration templates deployed in staging and produce expected notifications/artifacts.
- **KPIs:**
  - % of squads trained and certified (target: 90% within first quarter).
  - Reduction in audit-support slack tickets (>60% drop after rollout).
  - SLA adherence for scheduled audit jobs (>95% of runs executed on time).
- **Integration tests:**
  - Smoke test pipeline triggered via orchestrator template to ensure compatibility with CI/CD and deployment environments.
  - Docs publishing workflow integrated with GitHub Actions to verify no broken links or missing assets before release.
