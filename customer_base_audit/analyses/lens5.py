Lens 5: Overall Customer Base Health

TODO: Implement comprehensive customer base health module that provides:
- Current period snapshot (via Lens 1)
- Multi-cohort comparison (via Lens 4)
- Customer base composition by cohort
- Revenue distribution by cohort
- Weighted retention rate across entire customer base

This is the highest-level analysis that combines insights from
all other lenses to provide a complete health assessment.

See: thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-08-enterprise-clv-implementation.md
     for detailed implementation specifications.
