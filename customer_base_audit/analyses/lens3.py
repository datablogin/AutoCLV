Lens 3: Single Cohort Evolution

TODO: Implement cohort evolution tracking module that provides:
- Cohort identification and metadata (acquisition date, initial size)
- Period-by-period cohort metrics tracking
- Cohort retention curves
- Revenue evolution by cohort over time

This module tracks how a single acquisition cohort performs
across multiple periods.

See: thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-08-enterprise-clv-implementation.md
     for detailed implementation specifications.
