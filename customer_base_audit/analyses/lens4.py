Lens 4: Multi-Cohort Comparison

TODO: Implement multi-cohort comparison module that provides:
- Comparison across multiple acquisition cohorts
- Cohort quality trends over time
- Best/worst performing cohort identification
- Average retention rates by period across cohorts

This module analyzes how different cohorts compare to each other
and identifies quality trends across acquisition periods.

See: thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-08-enterprise-clv-implementation.md
     for detailed implementation specifications.
