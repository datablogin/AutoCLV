Lens 2: Period-to-Period Comparison

TODO: Implement period-to-period comparison module that provides:
- Comparison of Lens 1 metrics between two periods
- Customer migration analysis (new, retained, churned, resurrected)
- Retention and churn rate calculations
- Period-over-period growth metrics

This module depends on Lens 1 and should analyze how the customer
base evolves between two time periods.

See: thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-08-enterprise-clv-implementation.md
     for detailed implementation specifications.
