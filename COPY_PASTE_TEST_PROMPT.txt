Test the Phase 4A observability features:

1. Run health_check - verify server is healthy and check what foundation data is available

2. Load sample data: load_transactions with path /Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/tests/fixtures/synthetic_transactions_2023_2024.csv

3. Run health_check again to see how foundation data status has changed

4. Run orchestrated analysis: run_orchestrated_analysis with query "Give me the overall customer base health"

5. Run another analysis: run_orchestrated_analysis with query "customer health snapshot"

6. Run multi-lens analysis: run_orchestrated_analysis with query "customer health and overall base health"

7. Check performance metrics: get_execution_metrics - review the statistics for all lens executions

8. Run final health_check to see updated system status

Please report:
- Health status before and after loading data
- Execution metrics summary (total analyses, success rate, per-lens statistics)
- Any interesting insights from the analyses
- Any issues or errors encountered
