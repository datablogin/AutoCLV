=====================================================
FINAL FIX TEST - JSON Parsing Issue Resolved
Copy this into Claude Desktop
=====================================================

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
================================

The LLM was being invoked correctly, but failing with:
"Invalid JSON in Claude response: Invalid control character at: line 18 column 403"

Claude's narrative responses contain newlines and special characters that break
strict JSON parsing. Fixed by adding `strict=False` to json.loads().


TEST THE FIX:
=============

STEP 1: Restart Claude Desktop
-------------------------------
You MUST restart Claude Desktop to load the updated code!


STEP 2: Load Foundation Data
-----------------------------

Run load_transactions with file_path: /Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/.worktrees/track-a/synthetic_transactions.json

Build foundation (run in sequence):
- build_customer_data_mart
- calculate_rfm_metrics
- create_customer_cohorts

Verify ready:
Run health_check


STEP 3: Test LLM Synthesis (Should Work Now!)
----------------------------------------------

Run run_orchestrated_analysis with:
- query: "Tell me about customer health and which cohorts are performing best"
- use_llm: true
- use_cache: false


EXPECTED SUCCESS:
=================

✅ Duration: 2-10 seconds (LLM call)
✅ narrative field: PRESENT and populated with detailed text (should be 500-2000 chars)
✅ token_usage: Shows input/output tokens
✅ cache_hit: false (first run)
✅ No errors in logs!


STEP 4: Test Caching
---------------------

Run the EXACT same query again with use_cache: true

Expected:
✅ Duration: <100ms (instant!)
✅ narrative: Same as Step 3
✅ cache_hit: true
✅ Cost: $0.00


SUCCESS CRITERIA:
=================

[ ] Step 3: narrative field is present and detailed
[ ] Step 3: No "llm_synthesis_failed_falling_back_to_simple" in logs
[ ] Step 3: Execution takes 2-10 seconds
[ ] Step 4: Cache hit confirmed (instant response)
[ ] No JSON parsing errors


WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============

File: analytics/services/mcp_server/orchestration/result_synthesizer.py
Line: 329
Change: json.loads(content.strip()) → json.loads(content.strip(), strict=False)

This allows Claude's narrative to contain newlines, tabs, and other control
characters without breaking JSON parsing.
