DEBUG LLM SYNTHESIS ISSUE
Copy this into Claude Desktop
=====================================================

I've added debug logging to trace the LLM synthesis execution.

STEP 1: RELOAD FOUNDATION DATA
================================

Load sample data:
Run load_transactions with file_path: /Users/robertwelborn/PycharmProjects/AutoCLV/.worktrees/track-a/synthetic_transactions.json

Build foundation (run in sequence):
- build_customer_data_mart
- calculate_rfm_metrics
- create_customer_cohorts

Verify ready:
Run health_check


STEP 2: RUN WITH LLM (CHECK LOGS)
===================================

Run run_orchestrated_analysis with:
- query: "Tell me about customer health and which cohorts are performing best"
- use_llm: true
- use_cache: false

EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT IN LOGS:
------------------------------
You should see these log entries in your MCP server logs (stderr) IN THIS ORDER:

1. orchestrated_analysis_received
   - query: "Tell me about customer health..."
   - use_llm: true
   - use_cache: false

2. coordinator_initialized_with_llm (or coordinator_initialized_without_llm)
   - use_llm: true (should be true!)
   - query_interpreter_initialized: true (should be true!)
   - result_synthesizer_initialized: true (should be true!)

3. synthesizing_results
   - use_llm: true (should be true!)
   - result_synthesizer_exists: true (should be true!)
   - will_attempt_llm: true (should be true!)

4. attempting_llm_synthesis (only if will_attempt_llm was true)
   - query: "Tell me about customer health..."

5. synthesis_complete_with_llm (only if LLM synthesis succeeded)
   - narrative_length: (should be > 0)

OR if LLM synthesis failed:

5. llm_synthesis_failed_falling_back_to_simple
   - error: (error message)
   - error_type: (exception type)


WHAT TO CHECK:
==============

After running Step 2, check your Claude Desktop logs for each message:

✅ Log Entry #1: orchestrated_analysis_received
   - Did it receive use_llm: true?
   - Did it receive use_cache: false?
   - If NO: The parameters aren't being passed correctly from Claude Desktop

✅ Log Entry #2: coordinator_initialized_with_llm
   - Does it say "coordinator_initialized_with_llm" (not "without_llm")?
   - Are query_interpreter_initialized and result_synthesizer_initialized both true?
   - If NO: The API key check is failing OR use_llm is being set to False

✅ Log Entry #3: synthesizing_results
   - Is use_llm: true?
   - Is result_synthesizer_exists: true?
   - Is will_attempt_llm: true?
   - If ANY are false: We've found the bug!

✅ Log Entry #4: attempting_llm_synthesis
   - Does this message appear?
   - If NO: The condition check at line 1023 is failing (check values from #3)
   - If YES: LLM synthesis is being attempted (good!)

✅ Log Entry #5a: synthesis_complete_with_llm
   - Does this appear?
   - What is narrative_length? (should be > 100)
   - If appears: SUCCESS! LLM synthesis worked!

✅ Log Entry #5b: llm_synthesis_failed_falling_back_to_simple
   - Does this appear instead of #5a?
   - What is the error message?
   - What is the error_type?
   - If appears: LLM synthesis was attempted but failed (check error for reason)


WHERE TO FIND LOGS:
===================

Claude Desktop logs are typically at:
- macOS: ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
- Look for the most recent log file

Or check stderr output in Claude Desktop's MCP server output panel.


REPORT BACK:
============

Please share:
1. Which log messages appear (1-5 from above)
2. The values shown in each log message
3. Any error messages you see
4. The response you received (especially duration and narrative field)

This will tell us exactly where in the code path the LLM synthesis is failing.
